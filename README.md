# self_made_commands
This folder contains all self-made 'fish' commands.
## How To Use
All of commands work best with `fish`. 

Please make sure to compile the c-programs yourself. Some executibles only work on some specific machines. 

First when you cloned the repo, in your `fish`, type the following `fish_add_path {location of the repo}`.

For Python files the first line is my location of python, when used please use your own location of python. If you can not find your location of python, try typing `which python` in your terminal.
