# self_made_commands
This folder contains all self-made 'fish' commands.
## How To Use
All of commands work best with `fish`. 

Please make sure to compile the c-programs yourself. Some executibles only work on some specific machines. 

First when you cloned the repo, in your `fish`, type the following `fish_add_path {location of the repo}`.

For Python programmed commands, I tried to use some Python programs to force the file to be executibles, but unfortunately, all of programs become very slow. I figured that maybe it's better to just use `fish` alias. 

Before trying Python commands, please type `alias {python file name without .py} {python python file name with .py}` in your `fish` and then type `funcsave {python file name without .py}`.
